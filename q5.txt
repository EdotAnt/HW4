1.No 
2.Yes 
3.Yes they differ because increment_int_a(someval) is passed by value while increment_int_b(someval) is passed by
reference, meaning after increment_int_a(someval) ends, someval keeps its original value before the function was 
called, while after increment_int_b(someval) ends, someval keeps the changes that were made in the function.
